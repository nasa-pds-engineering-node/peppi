PDS Peppi
=========

The **Peppi Open-Source Python Library** provides an intuitive interface for the research community to query and extract data from the `Planetary Data System (PDS) <https://pds.nasa.gov>`_.

Peppi is powered by the robust `PDS web API <https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds-api/>`_, which offers consistent access to data products from Planetary Archive of NASA and other participating agencies. These products are described using the comprehensive `PDS4 standard <https://pds.nasa.gov/datastandards/about/>`_.

Recognizing the vast and unpredictable range of scientific use cases, and the rich complexity of the PDS4 standard, Peppi is an evolving project. We invite you to :doc:`support/contribute` to its development and help shape its future.
